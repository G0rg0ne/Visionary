num_samples: 17  # Need > 16 so each flight has >= 17 points (8 train + 9 test)

timeseries_preparation:
  forward_fill_limit: 3

train_test_split:
  test_timesteps: 9  # Each flight: 9 test steps (AutoGluon requires length > prediction_length, i.e. >= 8)
  min_train_timesteps: 8  # Minimum timesteps required in train per flight
